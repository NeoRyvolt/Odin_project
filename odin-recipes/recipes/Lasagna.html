                    <li>9-12 lasagna noodles(oven-ready/no-boil recommended for ease)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <b>Preparation (approx. 20-25 mins)</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat Oven and Prep Veggies: <br>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and zucchini. Sauté until tender and lightly browned, about 7-10 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic.</li>
                    <li>Make the Veggie Marinara: <br>Add the marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to the skillet with the sautéed veggies. Bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped spinach until it wilts.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: <br>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, beaten egg (if using), fresh herbs, and seasoning. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Prepare Noodles (If Not Using Oven-Ready): <br>If using regular dried lasagna noodles, cook them in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and toss with a little olive oil to prevent sticking. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Assembly (Approx. 10 mins)</b>
                use a 9x13 inch baking dish for layering.
                <ol>
                    <li>Layer 1 (Bottom): <br>Spread about 1 cup of the veggie marinara sauce evenly over the bottom of the dish.</li>
                    <li>Layer 2: <br>Lay 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, breaking them to fit as needed.</li>
                    <li>Layer 3: <br>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                    <li>Layer 4: <br>Top with a third of the remaining veggie marinara sauce, then sprinkle with a third of the mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Layer 5: <br>Add another layer of noodles</li>
                    <li>Layer 6: <br>Spread the remaining ricotta mixture over the noodles</li>
                    <li>Layer 7: <br>Top with another third of the remaining sauce and a third of the mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Layer 8 (Top): <br>Add the final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top, making sure the noodles are completely covered, then sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Baking (Approx. 45-50 mins)</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cover and Bake: <br>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil (spray the underside with cooking spray to prevent the cheese from sticking). Place the dish on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake for 35 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Rest and Serve: <br>Let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This is a crucial step that allows the layers to set, preventing a soupy lasagna. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired. </li>
